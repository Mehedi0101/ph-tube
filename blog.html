                <p>
                    One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for
                    variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you. In this article, we'll discuss var, let, and const with respect to their scope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use. var declarations are globally
                    scoped or function/locally scoped. The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a
                    function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is
                    available for use in the whole window. var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function. To understand further, look at the example below.
                </p>

                <p class="font-mono text-xs md:text-base">
                     var greeter = "hey hi"; <br>
                    function newFunction() { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var hello = "hello"; <br>
                    } <br>
                    console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined
                </p>

                <p>We'll get an error which is as a result of hello not being available outside the function.</p>

                <p>
                    let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so. A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block. So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block. Let me explain this with an example:
                </p>

                <p class="font-mono text-xs md:text-base">
                    let greeting = "say Hi"; <br>
                    let times = 4; <br>
                    if (times > 3) { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let hello = "say Hello instead"; <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead" <br>
                    } <br>
                    console.log(hello) // hello is not defined <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We see that using hello outside its block (the curly braces where it was defined) returns an error. This is because let variables are block scoped.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared. This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.

                    In JavaScript undefined and null are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings and use cases. Undefined represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. Null, on the other hand, represents a deliberate absence of any object value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Null is a special value that is used to represent the deliberate absence of an object value. It is
                    often used as a placeholder value when a variable or property is intentionally left empty or does
                    not exist. Unlike undefined, null is an explicitly assigned value. In TypeScript, you can assign
                    null to a variable or property to indicate that it has no object value. For example:
                </p>

                <p class="font-mono text-xs md:text-base">let myVar = null;</p>

                <p>
                    Null is commonly used in conditional statements or functions to check if a variable or property has
                    been assigned a value. For example, if you have a function that expects a value but wants to handle
                    the case where the value is not present, you can check for null:
                </p>

                <p class="font-mono text-xs md:text-base">function printName(name = null) { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (name !== null) { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(name); <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else { <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('No name provided'); <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br>
                    } <br>
                    printName('Alice'); // output: Alice <br>
                    printName(null); // output: No name provided <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Null can also be used in combination with other values, such as strings or numbers, to indicate that they have no meaningful value. For example, in a database, a column that has not been populated with a value might be represented as null.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Uninitialized variables are automatically assigned the value of undefined. This means that if you
                    declare a variable but don't assign it a value, its value will be undefined. For example, the
                    following code declares a variable myVar but does not assign it a value, so its value is undefined:
                </p>

                <p class="font-mono text-xs md:text-base"> 
                    let myVar;<br>
                    console.log(myVar); // output: undefined
                </p>

                <p>You can also explicitly assign undefined to a variable or property:</p>

                <p class="font-mono text-xs md:text-base"> 
                    et myVar = undefined; <br>
                    console.log(myVar); // output: undefined
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to note that assigning undefined to a variable or property is generally considered bad practice, as it can lead to confusing and error-prone code. If you need to indicate the absence of an object value, it's better to use null, which is a more explicit and intentional value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, automatic assignment of undefined to uninitialized variables can be helpful for preventing
                    errors and catching bugs early in development. However, it's important to handle undefined values
                    correctly in your code and avoid using them when null is a more appropriate value.

                    Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In HTTP there are five methods that are commonly used in a REST-based Architecture i.e., POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These correspond to create, read, update, and delete (or CRUD) operations respectively. There are other methods which are less frequently used like OPTIONS and HEAD. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="font-bold">GET:</span>The HTTP GET method is used to read (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the safe path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST). 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="font-bold">POST:</span> The POST verb is most often utilized to create new resources. In particular, it’s used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. On successful creation, return HTTP status 201, returning a Location header with a link to the newly-created resource with the 201 HTTP status.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="font-bold">PUT:</span> It is used for updating the capabilities. However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. On successful update, return 200 (or 204 if not returning any content in the body) from a PUT. If using PUT for create, return HTTP status 201 on successful creation. PUT is not safe operation but it’s idempotent. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="font-bold">PATCH:</span> It is used to modify capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource. This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch. PATCH is neither safe nor idempotent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="font-bold">DELETE:</span> It is used to delete a resource identified by a URI. On successful deletion, return HTTP status 200 (OK) along with a response body.
